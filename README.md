# sass_exercise

In this exercise I created a basic hello world page using Sass. Sass stands for (syntactically awesome stylesheets), which is a style sheet language.
Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes.
The original syntax, called "the indented syntax", uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. 
The newer syntax, "SCSS", uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. 
The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.
